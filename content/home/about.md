# About me

I'm Yan Li! I'm pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at <a
href="http://stat.uconn.edu/"> Departmemt of Statistics, University of
Connecticut</a> from starting from 2016. I recieved my B.S. degree in
Statistics from <a href="http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/"> Renmin University
of China</a> in 2016.

I enjoy using <a href="https://www.r-project.org"> R </a> and <a
href="https://www.python.org"> Python </a> to do statistical
analysis. And I'm currently working on developing statistical models
and R packages for climate change and errors-in-variables models.
Information for my research is avaliable at <a
href="/projects">Projects</a>.

I'm learning Javascript and PHP now. I will complete this webpage step
by step and share some experience of learning these things at the <a
href="#posts">Notes</a> section.
